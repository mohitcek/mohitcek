ABOUT ME

🚀 Passionate about Uncertainty Quantification and Data Science | Ph.D. Graduate from Johns Hopkins University

Welcome to my LinkedIn profile! I'm a highly motivated Ph.D. graduate from Johns Hopkins University, specializing in Uncertainty Quantification. My research journey has been marked by groundbreaking work in developing an active learning (ML) algorithm for global sensitivity analysis in large-scale wind tunnel experiments. This involved integrating wind tunnel experiments within an automated active learning framework, streamlining processes, minimizing human error, and significantly enhancing the rate of discovery.

🔍 Key Highlights:

Active Learning Maven: Pioneered the application of active learning algorithms to large-scale wind tunnel experiments, leveraging machine learning for global sensitivity analysis.
Python and Git Expertise: Contributed significantly to the Python library 'UQpy' as a developer, accumulating six years of hands-on experience in Python and Git.
Master's in Applied Mathematics and Statistics: My academic journey includes a master's degree that equipped me with a solid foundation in ML algorithms, such as SVM, random forests, and more. I specialize in Probability Theory, which forms the core of my research work in Uncertainty Quantification.
📈 Technical Proficiency:

Gaussian Process Regression: Adept in utilizing Gaussian process regression for implementing active learning algorithms, accumulating four years of hands-on experience.
🎓 Education:

Ph.D. in Uncertainty Quantification, Johns Hopkins University
Master's in Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Johns Hopkins University
B.Tech + M.Tech in Civil Engineering, IIT Kanpur
I am enthusiastic about exploring new opportunities, collaborating on innovative projects, and contributing to the dynamic world of uncertainty quantification and data science. Let's connect and explore the possibilities!
